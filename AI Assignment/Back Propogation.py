# Write an algorithm for back propagation training on multilayer feedforward network. The algorithm
# may take initial weight values, learning rate and input table from user (input table may be two input
# table of any logical gate). The algorithm must be capable of running perceptron learning algorithm
# and train the model. After training the user may be able to feed testing inputs and the algorithm
# may be able to generate output approximating the function. [Marks: 1]
