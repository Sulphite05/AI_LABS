# Write down a program for training a perceptron. The algorithm may take initial weight values,
# learning rate and input table from user (input table may be two input table of any logical gate). The
# algorithm must be capable of running perceptron learning algorithm and train the model. After
# training the user may be able to feed testing inputs and the algorithm may be able to generate output
# approximating the function. Show the practical demonstration to course instructor.


# must include at least two hidden layers
# Use of libraries is not allowed
